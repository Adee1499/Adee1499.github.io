								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<p>I'm a 2<sup>nd</sup> year Computer Science student passionate about programming, who loves solving problems. I am a comittee member of the newly founded, Computer Science Society at Heriot-Watt University.
									In my free time, when not working on coursework, I enjoy developing my own side projects some of which are available to view on my <a href="https://github.com/Adee1499" target="_blank">GitHub page</a> as well as participating in programming challenges.
								</p>
								<p>I have spent the last three years developing my skills in various different high-level procedural and/or object-oriented languages: <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, 
									<strong>C#</strong>, and <strong>C</strong>, as well as some functional / logic languages: <strong>Prolog</strong> and <strong>OCaml</strong>. During the course of my studies I have also 
									touched upon <strong>ARM Assembly</strong>. I have had several opportunities to develop a few websites as well as a 
									browser game, using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.  By the way, check out my <a href="#projects">awesome projects here</a>!</p>

                                <h3>Puzzle room game</h3>
                                <p>This was my most recent personal project, a short game developed in Unity. The objective of the game is to solve a handful of puzzles in order to obtain a 6-letter code unlocking a physical <i>cryptex</i> (Da Vinci's "portable vault").</p>

                                </p>
								<p>The project has presented itself with a few challenges, it showed how important planning the project ahead as well as code reusability is, not only in game dev, but generally, in software development.</p>

								<h3>Pacman socket.io multiplayer game</h3>
                                <p>Developed as part of a team for university coursework (Web Programming course). The objective was to develop an online multiplayer 2D browser game using strictly DOM manipulation, and without using any game engines or the HTML Canvas element. </p>
                                <p align="center">
                                    <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CRW8lzE-pPo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                </p>
                                <p>The game runs on Node.js, using npm as a package manager (Babel for backwards compatibility, Parcel for bundling JS files together, and Socket.io for client-server communication).
									Players are randomly assigned either a ghost or a Pacman (probability percentage can be edited in the source code). Both types can eat "food" for points, however only Pacmen can eat the powerup pills, and once they do they are able to eat ghosts.
									Server is mainly acting as a relay, sending information between all the clients. See the GitHub repository for more insight.</p>

                                <h3>Nonogram party (IN PROGRESS)</h3>
                                <p>A single and multiplayer mobile game I am currently developing in Unity, in collaboration with a team of graphic designers in Italy. It's targeted mainly for the Android platform but with success potentially also ported to iOS.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/1.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Nonograms (also known as picross, paint-by-numbers, or griddlers) are logic puzzles in which cells must be coloured according to numbers around the grid, 
									revealing a hidden picture.</p>
